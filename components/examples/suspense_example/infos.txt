✅ Suspense is great for handling initial data fetching if your setup supports it (useSuspenseQuery, React Server Components, or a Suspense-wrapped fetch).
✅ Suspense works great in a Page component because React can wait before showing the page.

❌ Suspense is bad for button clicks because it wipes out UI and waits until the data is ready.
❌ It’s not great if your fetch takes too long and users need immediate feedback.
For very slow APIs, consider progress indicators instead of just a blank Suspense fallback.

e.g: (generally in server "page" component)

<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <TodosClient />
</Suspense>
